Here are my tips & thoughts on selling from dispensers.

1) Set your RDMS for all dispensers (I add both of them listed) as a policy globally per player, construct or corp rather than setting up each dispenser with a tag + policy.
2) Hide your containers & ask for someone to check permissions. If you mess up RDMS, then people can rip you off. 
3) Consider your setup costs and time spent managing stock. A widget selling for 500 quanta profit, will take 45 sales just to pay off the dispencer.
4) Connecting more than one dispencer from one container is not possible and can add another 150k to the setup costs. 
5) Data items do not need space, use XS containers! 
6) Blueprints are cheap if you consider stock maintaince costs. Make at least 50 blueprints if you think your item will sell. 
7) Market prices fluxuate, bake in your margins if you are selling items.
8) More than one item can be sold per batch. I'd rather buy 1 door kit (detection zone + door + not gate) than buying all of these items sperately. 
9) Make your sales unique.... I don't care that your selling Nitron fuel.
10) Market terminals will make item dispencers obsolete, consider/prioritize things that will sell... and don't try to sell everything.
11) Dispencers are great at selling ship blueprints, or even all of the parts in kit to build your ship.
12) Claimed items cannot be sold from a dispenser.
13) Dispencers do not have a LUA api to Set the price, Set the batch Size, Order
14) Default options are crap. Limit 1 per, 
15) A batch of whatever you sell is stored in the dispencer, consider the costs of this batch.

Thoughts on blueprints (transfering rights, skill boosts, copy/edit permissions). 

Example RDMS:

Example Setup:

Experiment #1 : Selling empty (to be a dontation, admission fee, bet). 
Experiment #2 : Using a detection zone to log players (or trap them).
Experiment #3 : Use ammo containers instead of normal containers (lol, why Briggenti).
